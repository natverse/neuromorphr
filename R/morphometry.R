#' @title Return persistence vectors for queried neurons
#'
#' @description For each neuron corresponding to a given neuron name or neuron ID, return the persistence vectors
#' stored on neuromorpho.org. See details for a brief explanation for these persistence vectors.

#' 
#' Persistent homology is a methodology to characterise and summarise geometric shapes, as well as to describe meaningful features across scales. 
#' In this approach, a given shape is summarised using a mathematical construct called a "filtration", 
#' which consists of a nested sequence of subsets of the original shape. One can think of a filtration as a 
#' specific way to grow and generate the shape being examined. As we "filter" through the shape using this sequence, 
#' new topological features may be created and some older ones may be destroyed. In the case of neuronal morphologies, 
#' the standard swc format represents a tree embedded in three-dimensional physical space, and the observed features could be, 
#' for instance, neurite branches. Persistent homology tracks the creation ("birth") and destruction ("death") of these 
#' topological features during the filtration process. The resulting births and deaths of features are summarised in a 
#' so-called persistence diagram: a set of 2D points whose (x, y) coordinates represent the birth and death times of the features. 
#' The life-time of a feature (death time minus birth time) is called the persistence of this feature, encoding how long this 
#' feature exists during the filtration.
#' 
#' In particular, for the persistence feature included here, the descriptor function is derived from a simplified representation 
#' of the neuron that only considers the roots, bifurcations, and terminations while ignoring all continuation points along 
#' the branches. In other words, we put a straight segment between any two tree nodes (with degree not equal to 2); the weight 
#' of this arc is its Euclidean length. The descriptor function is the total length of the unique path (i.e., the geodesic distance) 
#' from the tree root (as specified in the SWC file) to any point in the tree. We then filter the neuron tree by sweeping it in 
#' decreasing function values, and compute the induced persistence diagram. Intuitively, the set of points in the persistence diagram 
#' captures a nested branch decomposition of the neuron tree with respect to the chosen description.
#' 
#' Finally, we convert the persistence diagram summary into a 1D persistence feature vector. The first two numbers in the persistence 
#' vector file represent the range (minimum and maximum values) of the descriptor function. The remaining entries represent the 
#' function values at 100 positions sampled uniformly in this range.
#' 
#' The original software code to compute Persistence Vectors from SWC files is available open source at the 
#' \href{https://github.com/Nevermore520/NeuronTools}{NeuronTools} repository.
